# Machine Learning using Advanced Algorithms and Visualization in R [Video]
This is the code repository for [Machine Learning using Advanced Algorithms and Visualization in R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-using-advanced-algorithms-and-visualization-r-vi?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788294980), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners to develop statistical software and data analysis. 

In this course, you will work through various examples on advanced algorithms, and focus a bit more on some visualization options. We’ll start by showing you how to use random forest to predict what type of insurance a patient has based on their treatment and you will get an overview of how to use random forest/decision tree and examine the model. Then, we’ll walk you through the next example on letter recognition, where you will train a program to recognize letters using a support Vector machine, examine the results, and plot a confusion matrix. 

After that, you will look into the next example on soil classification from satellite data using K-Nearest Neighbor where you will predict what neighborhood a house is in based on other data about it. Finally, you’ll dive into the last example of predicting a movie genre based on its title, where you will use the tm package and learn some techniques for working with text data.
